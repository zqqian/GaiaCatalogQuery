**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The UT1 date (n.b. not UTC) ut11+ut12 is a Julian Date,
**     apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments ut11 and
**     ut12.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any
**     of these ways, among others:
**
**            ut11           ut12
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
**     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
**     between resolution and convenience.  The date & time method is
**     best matched to the algorithm used:  maximum precision is
**     delivered when the ut11 argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
**     question and the ut12 argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
**     versa.
**
**  2) If the caller wishes to provide the Earth rotation angle itself,
**     the function iauAper can be used instead.  One use of this
**     technique is to substitute Greenwich apparent sidereal time and
**     thereby to support equinox based transformations directly.
**
**  3) This is one of several functions that inserts into the astrom
**     structure star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
**     astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.
**
**     The various functions support different classes of observer and
**     portions of the transformation chain:
**
**          functions         observer        transformation
**
**       iauApcg iauApcg13    geocentric      ICRS <-> GCRS
**       iauApci iauApci13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> CIRS
**       iauApco iauApco13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> observed
**       iauApcs iauApcs13    space           ICRS <-> GCRS
**       iauAper iauAper13    terrestrial     update Earth rotation
**       iauApio iauApio13    terrestrial     CIRS <-> observed
**
**     Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary SOFA models to
**     compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
**     supplied by the caller.
**
**     The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
**     parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
**     comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
**     observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
**     aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
**     transformation), and atmospheric refraction.
